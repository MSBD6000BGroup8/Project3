read_Cifar10_bp.py: Create hdf5 file to store the train, validation and test data for running CNN in SGD algorithm. (cifar-10-python.tar.gz was downloaded and extract to a folder “\cifar-10-batches-py\” in the working directory.)

standard_bp.py: Using the data generated from the output of read_Cifar10_bp.py (inside “\cifar-10-batches-py\”) to run CNN in SGD algorithm to produce brand mark result. (create a folder “\model\” in the working directory before running standard_bp.py)
